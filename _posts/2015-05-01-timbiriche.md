This is a very popular game called *Dots and Boxes* (*Timbiriche
in spanish*). The main objective of the game is to form a box shape
by joining the dots. You get one point for each box and if you form
one at your turn, you can have an extra movement.
The game ends when all the dots are connected and the winner is the
one with more boxes.

Built using Node.js and MongoDB. You can play the game either from the
**Web Application** or the **CLI app**.
