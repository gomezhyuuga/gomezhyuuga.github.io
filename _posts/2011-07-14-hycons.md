Multi-platform iconset. Originally developed for the KDE Desktop Environment
but ported to macOS and Windows.  This iconset reached the top one iconset
at KDE-Look.org.

I personally designed each icon, walking through many iterations. Initially,
every icon was crafted using Inkscape but then I migrated them to Illustrator
and Photoshop.
