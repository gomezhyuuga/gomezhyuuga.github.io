The article proposes a novel approach for solving the **[Knapsack 0-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem)** problem; a **Hyper Heuristic**
that uses information of the _items profit and weight distributions_ and choses the _best_ item
so at the end you would be able to get the _optimal maximum profit_ achievable.
