__Prototype__ of a web application for a project when I was working at __[Hewlett Packard Enterprise Labs][HPE]__.

I designed it using __[Sketch][sketch]__ and then __[Invision][invision]__ to make it alive.

The application itself was intended to asses [investments on portfolio][portfolio] assets, driven by a _Machine Learning_
algorithm that suggested in which asset allocate more/less resources.
Multiple __scenarios__ of how to allocate assets (_right panel_) were created and for each one
a __[Value at Risk (VAR)][VAR]__ was predicted along with a _Net Worth_.
