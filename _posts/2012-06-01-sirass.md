Information System developed and deployed for a mexican University
called **UACM** (*Universidad Autónoma de la Ciudad de México*).
This project was part of my *social service* at High School.

The system helped the university to reduce considerably times of
administration processes such as student time tracking for their
social service reports and also communicate effectively with 
their audience.

It was successfully deployed and it still is being used by the
University.

Built using, mainly, Ruby on Rails and Javascript.
