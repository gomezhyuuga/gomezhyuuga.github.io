Distributed web application made in Django and MySQL
as DB backend. It was deployed using a *Master-Slave*
architecture in MySQL and a replication schema.

The application represents a *movie collection*,
where depending on your continent, the database of movies
was chosen from the MySQL distributed databases. Originally,
it was splitted into four databases: America, Europe, Asia and
Oceania.

I designed the UI from scratch and implemented it in Bootstrap.
