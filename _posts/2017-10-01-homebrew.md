Homebrew is a package manager for MacOS that lets you install new software in a very easy way. If you come from the linux world, then you can think of *homebrew* as an analogous version of *apt-get, yum, dnf, yaourt, etc.*

I would say that Homebrew is **a must** for any mac user and even more if you are a software developer.

## Installing Homebrew

The installation is very easy, you just have to run the following command in the terminal:

```shell
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

After installing it you should run `brew doctor` and check that everything is all right. If you don't see any error message, then you are done.
> Warning messages are not harmful

As you can see there is a new command available: `brew` thorugh the use of this utility you will be able to install and update the packages.

## Basic usage
Each piece of software is installed using the so called ***formuale***; they are just ruby *files* that indicate how to install each package in the system. The great thing about Homebrew is that it provides a DSL so anyone can create new *formulae*. Also, the system is very **transparent**, you can see how a package is going to be installed thorugh inspecting its formulae.

### Install new packages
`brew install <formulae>`

```shell
~ ‚ùØ brew install youtube-dl
