**[Homebrew][Homebrew]** is a package manager for MacOS that lets you install new software in a
very easy way. If you come from the Linux world, then you can think of *homebrew*
as analogous to *apt-get, yum, dnf, yaourt, etc.*

I would say that Homebrew is **a must** for any Mac user and even more if you are a software developer.

## Installing Homebrew

The installation is very easy, you just have to run the following command in the terminal:

```shell
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

After installing it you should run `brew doctor` and check that everything is all right. If you don't see any error message, then you are done.
> Warning messages are not harmful

As you can see, there is a new command available: `brew`. This utility enables you to install and update
packages in your system.

# Basic usage
Each piece of software is installed using the so called ***formuale***; they are just ruby *files* that indicate how to install each package in the system.
The great thing about Homebrew is that it provides a **[DSL][DSL]** so anyone can create new *formulae*. Also, the system is very **transparent**, you can see how a package is going to be installed thorugh inspecting its formulae.

## Install new packages
`brew install <formulae>`

```shell
~ ‚ùØ brew install youtube-dl
==> Downloading https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/releases/download/2017.10.01/youtube-dl-2017.10.01.
==> Downloading from https://github-production-release-asset-2e65be.s3.amazonaws.com/1039520/57a48802

Bash completion has been installed to:
  /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d

zsh completions have been installed to:
  /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
==> Summary
üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/youtube-dl/2017.10.01: 11 files, 1.9MB, built in 8 seconds
```

## Search packages
`brew search <name>`
```shell
~ ‚ùØ brew search http
==> Searching local taps...
darkhttpd           httpdiff            httpry              libmicrohttpd       weighttp
http-parser         httperf             httpstat            lighttpd
http-server         httpflow            httptunnel          mighttpd2
http_load           httpie ‚úî            libhttpserver       nghttp2
...
```

> It will show a checkmark (‚úî) if the formulae is already installed.

## List installed packages
`brew ls`

```shell
~ ‚ùØ brew ls
ack			exiftool		gmp			libevent		libyaml			neovim			python3			tree
atool			fontconfig		gobject-introspection	libffi			little-cms2		node			ranger			unibilium
...
```

## Update the packages repository
`brew update`
> You should do this quite often in order to keep the package's database updated.

```shell
‚ùØ brew update                                                           1s 582ms

macvim ‚úî                   gegl                       osquery
...
```

## Upgrade installed software
`brew upgrade`
> It upgrades any installed package. You should probably run `brew update` beforehand.

```shell
‚ùØ brew upgrade                                                         25s 457ms

# Discussion
Personally, I use Homebrew almost every day and I'm sure that anything I'd need as a developer can
be found there. The most amazing thing for me is the way it works... if you look closely, it is based
entirely on *Git, plain Ruby DSL code and a defined process of user contributions through commits*.
