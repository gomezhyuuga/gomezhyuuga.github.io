Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) application to test validity
of inputs against an alphabet and transition function.

A **Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)** is defined as a *5-tuple*
$$M = (Q, \Sigma, q_0, F, \delta) $$, where:

- $$Q      $$: is a finite set of states
- $$\Sigma $$: is an alphabet
- $$q_0 $$: is an *initial state*
- $$F $$: is a set of accepted states
- $$\delta $$: is a *transition function* which determines how to jump from one state to another.
